# rag-query Specification

## Purpose

TBD - created by archiving change 'rag-query'. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Chunk builder aggregates Whisper segments

The backend SHALL provide a chunk-builder service that groups consecutive `transcript_segments` into `transcript_chunks` with overlap context. Each chunk's MIDDLE region (the segments that "belong" to the chunk) SHALL contain between 5 and 10 segments and SHALL span between 30 and 60 seconds, whichever bound is reached first. The builder SHALL prefer to close a chunk at a segment-gap exceeding 1.5 seconds when the current middle region has at least 5 segments and at least 30 seconds. Each chunk's `text` field SHALL contain the concatenation of one preceding overlap segment + the middle segments + one following overlap segment, joined by single spaces; `segment_ids` SHALL contain ONLY the middle-region segment UUIDs (not the overlap segments); `start_time` SHALL equal the first middle segment's `start_time`; `end_time` SHALL equal the last middle segment's `end_time`. A final partial chunk SHALL be emitted for any remaining middle segments at end-of-input.

#### Scenario: Middle region closed at 60s upper bound

- **WHEN** the builder consumes segments where the cumulative duration of the middle region reaches or exceeds 60 seconds before 10 segments are accumulated and no segment-gap > 1.5s has been observed
- **THEN** the builder SHALL close the chunk at the segment that crossed the 60s threshold

#### Scenario: Middle region closed at 10-segment upper bound

- **WHEN** 10 consecutive segments span less than 60 seconds with no segment-gap > 1.5s
- **THEN** the builder SHALL close the chunk after exactly 10 middle segments

#### Scenario: Middle region closed early at natural gap

- **WHEN** the middle region has accumulated at least 5 segments AND at least 30 seconds AND the next segment begins more than 1.5 seconds after the previous segment ends
- **THEN** the builder SHALL close the current chunk before the gap and start a new chunk after the gap

#### Scenario: Overlap context appended to chunk text

- **GIVEN** a chunk whose middle region is segments `[s2, s3, s4, s5, s6]`
- **WHEN** the builder serialises the chunk
- **THEN** the chunk's `text` SHALL equal `"<text of s1> <text of s2> <text of s3> <text of s4> <text of s5> <text of s6> <text of s7>"` (one segment of overlap on each side)
- **AND** `segment_ids` SHALL equal `[s2.id, s3.id, s4.id, s5.id, s6.id]` (no overlap)
- **AND** `start_time` SHALL equal `s2.start_time`
- **AND** `end_time` SHALL equal `s6.end_time`

#### Scenario: First chunk has no preceding overlap

- **WHEN** the builder closes the first chunk of a transcript whose middle starts at segment `s1`
- **THEN** the chunk's `text` SHALL begin at the middle's first segment (no preceding overlap exists) and SHALL include one trailing overlap segment if available

#### Scenario: Last chunk has no trailing overlap

- **WHEN** the builder closes the final chunk and no further segments remain after the middle region
- **THEN** the chunk's `text` SHALL include one preceding overlap segment if available and SHALL end at the middle's last segment

#### Scenario: Trailing partial middle flushed

- **WHEN** the builder reaches end-of-input with fewer than 5 accumulated middle segments and less than 30 seconds accumulated middle duration
- **THEN** the builder SHALL emit one final chunk containing the remaining segments as the middle region (with overlap as available), provided at least one middle segment remains

### Requirement: Chunk embeddings generated after successful transcription

The backend SHALL call OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` to produce a 1536-dimensional vector for each chunk, and SHALL persist chunks with their embeddings into `transcript_chunks` within the same worker task that completed transcription. Chunks SHALL be embedded in batches of at most 64 texts per API call.

#### Scenario: Embeddings persisted on successful transcription

- **WHEN** a `transcribe_episode` worker task successfully persists all transcript segments for an episode
- **THEN** the task SHALL build chunks from those segments, request embeddings via OpenAI, and insert one row per chunk into `transcript_chunks` with the returned 1536-dim vector before setting the transcript status to `completed`

#### Scenario: Embedding failure fails the transcript

- **WHEN** the OpenAI embeddings API raises an exception during chunk embedding
- **THEN** the worker task SHALL set the transcript status to `failed`, SHALL set `error_message` to the exception message (truncated to 2000 characters), and SHALL NOT leave any partial `transcript_chunks` rows for that transcript

#### Scenario: Batching respects size limit

- **WHEN** a transcript produces more than 64 chunks
- **THEN** the worker SHALL split the chunk list into consecutive batches of at most 64 texts and SHALL issue one embeddings request per batch, preserving chunk order

### Requirement: Semantic search endpoint returns ranked chunks

The backend SHALL expose `POST /shows/{show_id}/search` which SHALL be guarded by the `optional_auth_with_ip_limit` dependency (see auth-system + ip-rate-limit capabilities). The endpoint accepts body `{"question": "<non-empty string>", "k": <optional int 1-50, default 8>}`. The endpoint SHALL embed the question using the configured embedding step, jieba-tokenise the question for lexical matching using the current custom dictionary (see tokenizer-dictionary capability), and perform hybrid retrieval combining semantic (pgvector cosine distance) and lexical (PostgreSQL tsvector ts_rank) signals via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Retrieval SHALL be performed against `transcript_chunks` AND `episode_description_chunks` (see episode-description-index capability) filtered to the specified `show_id`, both ranked by RRF and then unioned, with the final top-K returned by descending RRF score. Each result SHALL carry a `source` discriminator equal to `"transcript"` or `"description"`. The endpoint SHALL NOT include any LLM-generated answer. The endpoint SHALL NOT decrement `quota_remaining` even for authenticated callers.

#### Scenario: RRF combines semantic and lexical ranks

- **GIVEN** `transcript_chunks` semantic top-50 returns chunk `A` at rank 3 and chunk `B` at rank 50
- **AND** `transcript_chunks` lexical top-50 returns chunk `A` at rank 25 and chunk `B` at rank 1
- **WHEN** the endpoint computes RRF scores with constant `k=60`
- **THEN** chunk `A`'s RRF score SHALL equal `1/(60+3) + 1/(60+25)` and chunk `B`'s RRF score SHALL equal `1/(60+50) + 1/(60+1)`
- **AND** chunk `A` SHALL rank higher (~0.0276 vs ~0.0255 — semantic-rank-3 contribution outweighs B's lexical-rank-1 with k=60)

#### Scenario: Chunk hit only on one side scored with placeholder rank

- **WHEN** chunk `C` is in the semantic top-50 at rank 10 but absent from the lexical top-50
- **THEN** chunk `C`'s RRF score SHALL be computed using `1/(60+10) + 1/(60+999)` where the absent-side rank is treated as a sentinel beyond the cutoff

#### Scenario: Description and transcript results unified by RRF score

- **GIVEN** a transcript chunk with RRF score 0.020 and a description chunk with RRF score 0.025
- **WHEN** the endpoint constructs the final ranked list
- **THEN** the description chunk SHALL appear before the transcript chunk in the response
- **AND** each result SHALL include `source: "transcript"` or `source: "description"` matching its origin

#### Scenario: Anonymous request under rate limit returns top-K hybrid results

- **GIVEN** an unauthenticated visitor whose IP counter is 5 and `ip_search_rate_limit_per_day=20`
- **WHEN** the visitor calls `POST /shows/{show_id}/search` with body `{"question": "歌單"}`
- **THEN** the IP counter SHALL become 6
- **AND** the embedding API SHALL be called once
- **AND** jieba tokenisation SHALL run once on the question
- **AND** the response SHALL be HTTP 200 with up to 8 ranked chunks (default k)
- **AND** the response SHALL NOT contain an `answer` field

#### Scenario: Anonymous request over rate limit is rejected without embedding call

- **GIVEN** an unauthenticated visitor whose IP counter is at the limit
- **WHEN** the visitor calls `POST /shows/{show_id}/search`
- **THEN** the response SHALL be HTTP 429 with `error_code='ip_rate_limited'`
- **AND** no embedding API call SHALL be made

#### Scenario: Authenticated request bypasses IP limit

- **GIVEN** an authenticated user from an IP whose counter is at the daily limit
- **WHEN** the user calls `POST /shows/{show_id}/search`
- **THEN** the request SHALL be processed
- **AND** the IP counter SHALL NOT be incremented
- **AND** the response SHALL be HTTP 200 with hybrid ranked results
- **AND** the user's `quota_remaining` SHALL NOT be decremented

#### Scenario: Search excludes other shows

- **WHEN** a search query is issued for `show_id=A` and a higher-scoring chunk exists for `show_id=B`
- **THEN** the response SHALL NOT include any chunk (transcript or description) whose owning episode belongs to `show_id=B`

#### Scenario: Search excludes incomplete transcripts

- **WHEN** a search query is issued and one episode in the show has a transcript whose `status` is not `completed`
- **THEN** the response SHALL NOT include any transcript chunk from that incomplete transcript
- **AND** the response MAY still include the episode's description chunk if its description is non-empty

#### Scenario: k parameter is clamped

- **WHEN** the body has `{"k": 100}`
- **THEN** the response SHALL contain at most 50 chunks (the documented upper bound)

### Requirement: Chat endpoint answers with citations using Tier 2 RAG

The backend SHALL expose `POST /shows/{show_id}/query` guarded by `require_authenticated_user` and atomic quota decrement (see user-quota). The endpoint SHALL execute the Tier 2 RAG pipeline: (1) if the request includes a non-empty `messages` history, rewrite the question to a standalone form using the configured rewrite model; (2) embed the (rewritten) question AND jieba-tokenise it; (3) retrieve top 8 results via the same hybrid (RRF) retrieval as `/search`, against both `transcript_chunks` and `episode_description_chunks`; (4) generate an answer using the configured answer model with the retrieved chunks as grounding, requesting structured JSON output containing `answer` and `used_chunk_ids`; (5) return the answer together with only the citation chunks referenced in `used_chunk_ids`. Description-source citations SHALL be presented to the answer model with a clear marker (e.g. `desc:<episode_id>`) distinguishing them from transcript citations (`ep:<episode_id>@<start_time>`). If JSON parsing of the model output fails, the endpoint SHALL fall back to returning the raw text as `answer` with all retrieved chunks as `citations`. This endpoint SHALL NOT accept anonymous callers and SHALL NOT consult the IP rate limit.

#### Scenario: Hybrid retrieval result feeds answer prompt

- **WHEN** a chat-mode query is issued and hybrid retrieval returns 5 transcript chunks and 3 description chunks
- **THEN** the answer prompt SHALL list all 8 results, each prefixed with `ep:<episode_id>@<start_time>` for transcripts or `desc:<episode_id>` for descriptions
- **AND** the model is permitted to cite either form in `used_chunk_ids`

#### Scenario: First turn skips rewrite

- **WHEN** a client calls `POST /shows/{show_id}/query` with an empty or missing `messages` array
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL NOT call the rewrite model, SHALL embed the original `question` directly, SHALL retrieve via RRF, and SHALL return an answer

#### Scenario: Follow-up turn uses rewritten question for retrieval

- **WHEN** a client calls with a non-empty `messages` history and a new `question` containing a pronoun
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL call the rewrite model, SHALL use the rewrite output as the retrieval query, and the answer model SHALL receive the original messages plus the new question (not the rewritten form) as conversation input

#### Scenario: Response includes only used citations

- **WHEN** chat mode completes successfully and the model returns valid JSON with `used_chunk_ids`
- **THEN** the response body SHALL contain `answer` (string) and `citations` (array containing only the chunks whose key appears in `used_chunk_ids`)

#### Scenario: Structured output parse failure falls back to full citations

- **WHEN** the answer model returns output that cannot be parsed as JSON or lacks the `answer` key
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL treat the entire model output as the `answer` string and SHALL return all retrieved chunks as `citations`

#### Scenario: Sliding window limit enforced

- **WHEN** a client sends a `messages` array longer than 10 entries
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL use only the most recent 10 entries when building prompts

#### Scenario: Anonymous request rejected with 401

- **WHEN** an unauthenticated request reaches `POST /shows/{show_id}/query`
- **THEN** the response SHALL be HTTP 401 with `error_code='not_authenticated'`
- **AND** no embedding or LLM API SHALL be called

### Requirement: Citation click navigates to transcript with highlight

The frontend ChatBubble citation badge SHALL be interactive. When a user clicks a citation badge, the application SHALL navigate to TranscriptPage for the cited episode and SHALL scroll to and visually highlight the transcript segment at the cited `start_time`. The highlight SHALL be applied as a background color accent for 3 seconds then fade out.

#### Scenario: Citation badge click navigates to transcript

- **WHEN** a user clicks a citation badge in a ChatBubble
- **THEN** the application SHALL navigate to TranscriptPage with `selectedEpisode.id` equal to the citation's `episode_id` and `highlightTime` equal to the citation's `start_time`

#### Scenario: Transcript highlights cited segment on load

- **WHEN** TranscriptPage mounts with a non-null `highlightTime`
- **THEN** the page SHALL scroll to the first segment whose `start_time` is closest to `highlightTime` and SHALL apply a 3-second highlighted background to that segment

### Requirement: LLM configuration is a singleton DB row

The backend SHALL store LLM gateway configuration in a `llm_config` table constrained to exactly one row (`id=1`). The row SHALL contain separate `base_url`, `api_key`, and `model` fields for the **answer** model and the **rewrite** model. Each `POST /shows/{show_id}/query` in chat mode SHALL read the current row once per request to construct its clients.

#### Scenario: Config updated via admin endpoint

- **WHEN** an authorized client calls `PUT /admin/llm-config` with new values for any subset of the 6 fields
- **THEN** the backend SHALL update only the provided fields on row `id=1`, SHALL set `updated_at` to the current UTC time, and SHALL return the updated row (with `api_key` fields masked)

#### Scenario: Config read via admin endpoint

- **WHEN** an authorized client calls `GET /admin/llm-config`
- **THEN** the backend SHALL return the current row, with both `answer_api_key` and `rewrite_api_key` replaced by the constant string `"***"` in the response body

#### Scenario: Missing API key rejects chat

- **WHEN** a chat-mode query is issued and either `answer_api_key` or `rewrite_api_key` is empty in the `llm_config` row
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL return HTTP 400 with an error message indicating the LLM is not configured, and SHALL NOT call any upstream LLM

#### Scenario: Updated config takes effect on next request

- **WHEN** a client updates `llm_config` via `PUT /admin/llm-config` while no query is in flight
- **THEN** the next `POST /shows/{show_id}/query` (chat mode) SHALL use the new `base_url`, `api_key`, and `model` values without requiring a backend restart

### Requirement: Query endpoint maps OpenAI exceptions to friendly error responses

The backend SHALL catch OpenAI client exceptions raised during embedding, rewrite, or answer calls within `POST /shows/{show_id}/query` and convert each to an `HTTPException` whose body matches the unified error response schema. The mapping SHALL be:

- `openai.RateLimitError` whose error body code equals `"insufficient_quota"` SHALL produce HTTP 429 with `error_code = "llm_quota_exceeded"`.
- `openai.RateLimitError` for any other reason SHALL produce HTTP 429 with `error_code = "llm_rate_limited"`.
- `openai.AuthenticationError` SHALL produce HTTP 502 with `error_code = "llm_auth_failed"`.
- `openai.APIConnectionError` and `openai.APITimeoutError` SHALL produce HTTP 503 with `error_code = "llm_unavailable"`.

The `provider` field of the error response SHALL be derived from the call site: requests that go through the embeddings service SHALL set `provider = "OpenAI"` (since embeddings always target the official OpenAI endpoint); chat and rewrite requests SHALL set `provider` to the value returned by `infer_provider_label` applied to the configured `answer_base_url` or `rewrite_base_url`.

#### Scenario: Embeddings rate limit returns 429 with quota_exceeded

- **WHEN** the embeddings service raises `openai.RateLimitError` with body `{"error": {"code": "insufficient_quota"}}` during a query request
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL respond HTTP 429 with body `{"detail": {"error_code": "llm_quota_exceeded", "provider": "OpenAI", "detail": <message>}}`

#### Scenario: Chat rate limit identifies Zeabur AI Hub provider

- **WHEN** the answer model is configured with `answer_base_url` containing `"zeabur"` and the chat call raises `openai.RateLimitError` not matching `insufficient_quota`
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL respond HTTP 429 with `provider = "Zeabur AI Hub"` and `error_code = "llm_rate_limited"`

#### Scenario: Authentication error returns 502

- **WHEN** any OpenAI client call within the query endpoint raises `openai.AuthenticationError`
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL respond HTTP 502 with `error_code = "llm_auth_failed"` and the appropriate `provider` label

#### Scenario: Connection error returns 503

- **WHEN** any OpenAI client call within the query endpoint raises `openai.APIConnectionError` or `openai.APITimeoutError`
- **THEN** the endpoint SHALL respond HTTP 503 with `error_code = "llm_unavailable"` and the appropriate `provider` label

#### Scenario: api_health record is preserved across the conversion

- **WHEN** the embeddings or chat service raises an OpenAI exception that the endpoint converts to an `HTTPException`
- **THEN** the underlying service SHALL still record one event via `api_health.record` for the failed call, and the endpoint SHALL NOT emit a duplicate record

### Requirement: Provider label is inferred from base URL

The backend SHALL provide a function `infer_provider_label(base_url: str | None) -> str` in the LLM configuration module that returns a human-readable label identifying the provider. The function SHALL return `"OpenAI"` when `base_url` is `None` or its hostname ends with `openai.com`, `"Zeabur AI Hub"` when the hostname contains `zeabur`, and the URL hostname (or `"External API"` when the hostname cannot be parsed) otherwise.

#### Scenario: None base_url returns OpenAI

- **WHEN** `infer_provider_label(None)` is called
- **THEN** the function SHALL return `"OpenAI"`

#### Scenario: Official OpenAI base URL returns OpenAI

- **WHEN** `infer_provider_label("https://api.openai.com/v1")` is called
- **THEN** the function SHALL return `"OpenAI"`

#### Scenario: Zeabur AI Hub base URL returns Zeabur AI Hub

- **WHEN** `infer_provider_label("https://aihub-xyz.zeabur.app/v1")` is called
- **THEN** the function SHALL return `"Zeabur AI Hub"`

#### Scenario: Unknown provider falls back to hostname

- **WHEN** `infer_provider_label("https://api.together.xyz/v1")` is called
- **THEN** the function SHALL return `"api.together.xyz"`

### Requirement: RAG query response includes stable query_id

The `POST /query` endpoint SHALL include a `query_id` field (opaque string, max 64 chars, unique per response) in its JSON response. The frontend SHALL use this `query_id` when posting to `/qa-feedback` and `/events` so server-side rows can be correlated with the originating answer. The `query_id` SHALL be generated server-side (not by the client) and SHALL be present on all successful query responses regardless of whether RAG returned answers.

#### Scenario: Successful query response includes query_id

- **WHEN** a logged-in user calls `POST /query` with a valid question
- **THEN** the JSON response SHALL contain a non-empty `query_id` string

#### Scenario: query_id values are unique across responses

- **GIVEN** the same user issues two consecutive `POST /query` requests with the same body
- **THEN** the two responses SHALL contain different `query_id` values

### Requirement: Hybrid retrieval implemented as a single SQL CTE

The hybrid retrieval logic SHALL be expressed as a single SQL statement using common table expressions (CTEs) — one for the semantic ranking, one for the lexical ranking, and one for the RRF score computation — followed by `FULL OUTER JOIN` and `ORDER BY rrf_score DESC LIMIT :k`. The implementation SHALL NOT introduce any third-party retrieval library (e.g., LlamaIndex, LangChain, Haystack). Both the per-side cutoff (top 50 each) and the RRF constant (`k_rrf = 60`) SHALL be defined as named constants in `backend/app/services/rag.py`.

#### Scenario: Single round-trip to Postgres per retrieval

- **WHEN** the retrieval function executes for one query
- **THEN** the application SHALL issue exactly one SQL statement covering both semantic and lexical paths plus the RRF combination

#### Scenario: No external retrieval library imported

- **WHEN** project source code under `backend/` is scanned for imports
- **THEN** no module SHALL import from `llama_index`, `langchain`, `langchain_*`, `haystack`, or any equivalent retrieval framework

##### Example: RRF constant

| Constant       | Value | Defined in                                |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `RRF_K`        | 60    | `backend/app/services/rag.py`             |
| `RRF_PER_SIDE` | 50    | `backend/app/services/rag.py`             |
| `RETRIEVAL_TOP_K` | 8  | `backend/app/services/rag.py` (existing)  |
